        <p>Here you will find all the information you need to contact
        your state's super delegates or the at-large ones.  Telephone,
        Email, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube &ndash; even snail mail
        addresses. You can 
        <a href="{% url 'delegate_list'%}">find your super delegate here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Many super delegates are very nice people doing their best in a system they didn't create.  If you choose to contact them <em>everyone</em> will appreciate the respectful tone you use.
        </p>

        <p> You can also see which super delegates are facing electoral
        challenges, and make donations to their opponents.  Some of the
        super delegates have been wanting to spend more time with their
        families, and if we can help them out then it's the right thing
        to do.  </p>

        <p>It turns out there are quite a few "Bernie
        Allies" out there.  Some are incumbents and a good
        number are candidates.  If you want to
        <a href="{% url 'candidate_list' %}">show them some love</a>,
        I'm sure they would appreciate it!  <p>

        Dear SuperDelegate,
        </p>

        <p>
        It's not you, it's me.  We've had a good run... 30 years!
        Has it been that long? At first it was great,
        such an improvement over those smoke-filled rooms.  But after
        decades of doing this <em>thing</em> whatever it is,
        I've changed.  Maybe you've changed too.  
        I don't know.  </p>

        <p>
        This is difficult for me to say, and it's probably hard for you to hear.
        I think we should end it.  There, I said it.  Whew!
        </p>

        <p>
        My friends kept asking me why I put up with you and I finally got
        tired of making excuses.  I feel taken for granted.  Used.  Like
        every four years my basic political rights are being violated.
        Like somehow I just don't <em>count</em> as much as you do.
        </p>

        <p>
        You always told me it was fate, that your candidate was the
        only candidate that would ever represent me.  For a long time
        I believed you, but now I realize <em>I'm good enough</em>. I
        deserve to be represented by someone who shares my political
        values.  </p>

        <p>
        With you it was always "my way or the highway."  Well, I'm taking
        the highway now.
        </p>

        <p>
        Since I'm being honest here I guess I should admit that I've
        met someone else.  I've been wanting more democracy in my life,
        and this person makes me feel the...  It's a
        sensation like freedom and first love and the 4th of July all
        rolled into one.  Is this what revolution feels like?  All I
        know is I want more!
        </p>

        <p>
        I will always remember you.  We had some good times.  I hope
        we can stay friends.  Maybe not right away, but... for now,
        </p>

        <p>
        It's over.
        </p>

        <p>
        Love always,<br/>
        Your little-d democratic voter
        </p>
