<h2 class="text-center">Superdelegate Chart</h1>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <p>This chart reveals the gulf between establishment Superdelegates
        and the American voters.  Sec. Clinton gets
        {{ clinton.data.0 }}% of the Superdelegates, but only
        {{ clinton.data.1 }}% of pledged delegates that people voted for.</p>

        <p> Why is it that the Superdelegates are so out of step with
        the voters?  Superdelegates are free to vote for whomever they
        like. Here's a tweet that sums it up by one well-known Superdelegate: </p>

        <blockquote>
            @D_Born @BernieSanders Super delegates don't "represent
            people" I'm not elected by anyone. I'll do what I think is
            right for the country<br/>
            â€” Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) March 5, 2016
        </blockquote>

            <p>
            Many of the Superdelegates made early pledges to
            Sec. Clinton, even before other candidates had announced.
            That is part of the game.  Early endorsements 
            discourage would-be challengers.</p>

            <p>However, there is something else at play in this
            primary.  In August of 2015, some 33 state Democratic
            parties made deals with the Hillary Clinton campaign and a
            joint fundraising entity called The Hillary Victory Fund.
            The arrangement, while technically legal, allows wealthy
            donors to circumvent already lax campaign finance laws.
            Additionally, </p>

            <blockquote>"One could reasonably infer... that
            the Superdelegates of these various partner
            states would either pledge loyalty to Clinton,
            or, at the least, not endorse Senator Sanders."<br/>
